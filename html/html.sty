html-hypertext markup language
html is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content 
if you right click and select view page source it gives the html code of the website
the component that are used to design the structure of websites are called html tags

//index.html
every wesite has its own homepage how to find homepage file as a website has many html files it is indicated by index.html
! select emmet  gives the boiler plate code

//html tag
a container for some content or other html 
<p>this is opening tag
</p> this is closing tag
<p> some matter </p> this full is called eleemnt 

//basic html page

<!DOCTYPE html>             //tells browser that you are using html where browser converts the html code given into webpage here document type is html
<html>                      // root of an html document
<head>                      //container for metadata about document
<title> my first page</title>   
</head>                //closing tag for head
<body>                 //contains all data rendered by the browser contain content tags

 <p>paragraphs</p>   // paragraph tag<p>
 <h1>headings</h1>   // heading tag<h1>
 </body>             //closing tag for body
 </html>             //closing html tag

 html tag is parent of head and body tag thats why head and body tags are called as siblings
 most of html elements have opening and closing tags with content in between 
 <br> is a break tag  and some tags have no content in between 
 we can use inspect element or view page source to edit html

 comment <!-- this is comment-->

 html is not case sensitive means a and A are same

 project 1 - create a file for your portfolio page

 //attributes
 along with tags there arre attributes html attributes
 attributes are useed to add more information to the tag 
<html lan="en"> lang attribute 

//heading tag
used to display headings in html
h1 most important and so on h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 (least important ) so on the heading font size decreses 

//paragraph tag
used to add apragraphs in html
<p>this is sample paragraph </p>   

//for the total data to be in one place then go to settings and go to command pallet then go to toggle word wrap then all data will be at one place wihtout using horizontal space within sam epage 

//anchor tag
used to add links to your page
<a href="some link">Google</a>
<br /> break tag is like newline/nextline tag
anchor tags are also used to call another file for relative links use '/' like even in another folder 

//image tag
<img src="image link" alt="Random Image"/>
for image resizing use height attribute height="100" and you can also set width width="50"

//break tag

html layouts
this may not webpage output(what we see) but this affects the way how it works

page layout techniques
use semantic tags for layout (two tags semantic and non semantic)
using the right tags 
<header>
<main>
<footer>

inside main tag
section tag for a section on your page<section>
article tag  for an article on your page<article>
aside tag   for content aside main content(ads)  <aside>

writing with paragraph tag and section tag may seem same but if you inspect the code differs  they reprsent differently

in anchor tag
another attribute target ="_main" then the link will open in another tab but not in the same in your webpage file
in anchor tag if you place image tag then it makes the image clickable as using only anchor tag makes the line mentioned clickable 
//div tag
div is a container used dor other html elements
it is non semantic tag as div tag has no specific tag
Block element(takes full width)
div is used to arrange grouply the elements(collectively elements) and modify them also can arrange them in tables

//span tag
span is also a container like div vut it is used for other html elements
inline element(takes width as per size) only the size it will take 

project add your image on the home page and useful links to your github/linkedin profiles also improve your project layout
