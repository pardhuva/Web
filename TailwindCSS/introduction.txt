//tailwindcss

 tailwindcss isnt just a styling framework it is utility-first ideology that makes modern responsive websites faster and easier 
 unlike bootstraps which comes with pre-defined components adn styles but tailwind gives you complete control through resuable utility classes 
 so instead of custom css from scratch you can simply combine these classes to style your site exactly how you want 

 . its like it will give you ingredients not whole packaged meal 

 you get the flexibility to customize  everything while keeping the codebase clean and neat 

 this tailwind has many component based libraries that helps to build it faster like 
  tailwind ui, headless ui, shadcn 


traditional css vs tailwind css 
  
  in traditional css you actually use classes for each tag elements then define each property 
  like for flex -> display: flex and so on in the custom classnames  

  but in tailwindcss we directly compose styles with utility classes 
  like you directly give <div className ="flex">

  every tailwind class is just a predefined rule 
  ex: you write flex -> then tialwind represents display:flex;

  here you dont need to worry about classnames and all 
  
  it is similar to inline styles but inline styles cant reuse them you have to write for everything 
  but tailwind utility classes are completely reusable  whcih means you can create a small set of reusable classes  and use them  on which ever element you want

 tailwind css generates styles on the fly  only for the classes we actually use this keeps the traditional css lean and efficient

//tailwind css is not only just about pre-defined utility classes  its also incredibly flexible  just in time compiler also known as jit  
 jit compiler generates styles on demand  which means tailwind keep only the exact styles your project uses keeping your final css small and  efficient 
  means it removes all the unused styles from the utilities and keep only the used applying ones 

jit is a big thing because 
  1. it optimizes performance  generating only what i need 
  2.  gives  you faster built time  because it doesnt need to pre-compile thousands of different classes  
  3. it supports arbitary values which means you can pass any custom size color or property to make  your website super unique
  4. it works seamlessly in both development and production 
  5. it is build completely into tailwind by default without any extra setup 

//layouts & flexboxes 

  it provides so many utilities 
  1. position -> where the element appears relative to its container or the viewport 
       relative -> moves element relative to its normal position 
       absolute ->  moves to the nearest parent 
       fixed   -> sticks the element to the viewport so it doesnt scroll 
       sticky ->  which behaves normally until  you scroll  
    
   2. display 
        block -> which takes full width  
        inline -> behaves like inline whcih behaves like text  whcih  doesnt have any width or height 
        flex -> enables flexbox
        grid -> enable css grid properties 

//in all the devies how to make it responsive tailwind makes responsive designn easy by using mobile first breakpoints 
   it gives you a set of predefined device widths ranging from small medim to large  
   by default they set a min-width  which means it sets styles for a specific screen width  or largeer not smaller 
   max-width  to setup styles for a specific screen width  or smaller 
   but for tailwind css the midwidth queries will be applied by default 

//media queries allow us to change css properties  dependign on the screne  width 
  media_queries.html 
  there sm-> small , md-> medium
  if you use sm:bg-purple-400 -> here minimum small width this applies that color 
   as by default minimum-width 
   but if you want maximum then you can assign like 
   max-sm:bg-purple-500 

//we can even customize oru breakpoints 

//using arbitary values 
  just-in-time compiler  it allows you to provide arbitary values which means that you can  give like 
   <div class="max-[600px]:bg-sky-300 min-[320px]:text-center> here fo rmin 320 you give text-center 

//darmode 
two ways to toggle darkmode manually 
  1. use prefers-color-scheme 
  2. use a data-attribute to automatically activate the theme 

  just add the dark before the utilities dark:bg-vlack


//how customizable tailwind css is 
  we can mas make everything customizable 
    by keeping it in [] ex:  text-[#973F29] 


suppose at multiple places you are using the same style and now you want to change something then you have to change at every place as all same style 
then you have to do changes everywhere that is when config comes 

//tailwind config 
   allows to control and organize the entire visual style of our application 
   for writing config we have use tailwind directives 
   configuring our pproject in a javascript file allows you  to configure directly within css 
    check chestnut.html and chestnut.css 
  
//suppose if you have button you want to use that in multiple files  then 
  1.  break the layout into multiple components instead of writing everything in a single page 
     so creating seperate component for button 
  2. use directives 
     tailwind css offers   directives for each of base, components, utilities  to define  specific styles 
     these three are parts of an approach to structuring adn organizing styles  usign configuration file method 
    base -> applies styles globally across our project  like fintsize of all h1 tags 
    components -> to style specific components or reusable ui elements  liek card , footers and more
    utilities -> atomic styles for individual  properties like  margins, padding, typography, colors 
    another directive called @apply  -> inserts tailwind css into css  
    @layer ->  we can create custom styles for  base components adn utilities 

     ex: cardComponent 

     so suppose if you want same style then you can create base or compoents  if you still want some differences between like you want one contain some flex then we use 
     utility given in the above cardCompoent.css 

//another way to improving tailwind css 
  - using useComponent libraries  liek shaten  which comes with set of predefined components like buttons 

//tailwind tips and tricks 
//special utilities
 . accent -> for checkbox and others you can have customized colors and all 
 . fluid texts -> when building responsive websites  so the text gets increase or decrease based on the devices
      usually we adjsut like sm:text-7xl text-5xl 
   but here text-[min(10vw,70px)]  
  . file 
     even for default layout we have to customize it 
     using file: => do all the customisations to the input 
  . highlights ->  when you want to overwrite somethign written  
     selecction: bg-green-400 
  . less js 
      open 
  . caret 
      caret-pink-500
