//Git 
version control system is a tools that helps to track changes in code 

Git is a Version  Control System. it is 
popular, free and open source , fast and scalable 

1 . track the history 
2 . colloborate 

//Github 

website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.

two-step process fro a repository 
 1. Add 
 2. commit

 //setting up Git 
 //download Git Bash for windows 

 //verify whether git is present or not 
 git --version 

//configuring Git - telling from which account we are doing the changes to git from github 
//global level and local level 
// ~ - root directory or main directory (directory means folder )

git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config -- global user.email"someone@email.com"
git config --list

//clone - Cloning a repository on our local machine   (local means our laptop/pc whereas remote means from github which includes from others account  )
        git clone <- some link ->
//status - displays teh state of the code 
        git status 

//after cloning change the directory (cd  repo name)

//for listing files -ls for listing hidden files ls -Force (for powershell) ls -a (for linux)

//untrackeed  - new files that git doesnt yet  track 
//modified - changed 
// staged - file is ready to be committed 
//unmodified - unchanged 

for solving untracked / modifed  bugs  ==>  we do add (staged)  ==> commit (unchanged)

//Add & commit 
add - adds new or changed in your working directory to the Git staging area 
      git add <-- file name -->

commit - it is the record of change 
       git commit -m "some message"

//for adding multiple files => (git add .)
//after add ==>  commit ==> push 

//push - upload local repo content to remote repo 
        git push origin main      (main is the branch and the origin is the default remote repo path )


//init command 
init - used to create a new git repo 
   git init 
   git remote add origin  <-- link-->      (to create the newly created repo as origin )
   git remote -v                           (to verify remote )
   git branch                              ( to check branch)
   git branch -M main                       ( to rename  branch)
   git push -u origin main --force 

//branch 
/**
You’re writing a book on your computer. Right now, you have one file with one version of your story — let’s call this the main version (like the main branch in Git).
Now, you want to try writing a new chapter, but you're not sure if it will be good. You don’t want to mess up the original story.
So what do you do?
You make a copy of the book and start writing the new chapter in that copy.
➡️ That copy is like a branch in Git.
You're working separately without changing the original.

//adding files from vscode to github       
  add  ==>  commit  ==>  push

//doing changes for repo in github
  clone ==> do changes ==>  add  ==>  commit  ==>  push

//from creating a folder in vscode and push the folder into the github
1. create a folder 
2. git init this create a git file 
3. create all required files
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "message"  //after this you cannot push because there is no repository 
6. create a repo name it as above folder 
7. git remote origin main  <-- link -->
8. git remote -v
9. git branch 
10. if not main then  change it (git remove -M main)
11 . now you push     git push -u origin main --force 



//workflow 
Local Git 

Git Branches 
Branch commands 
 
 git branch      ( to check branch)
 git branch -M main ( to rename branch )
 git checkout  <--branchname --> ( to move from one branch to another )
 git checkout -b <-- new branch name -->   ( to create new branch)
 git branch -d   <-- branch name -->     ( to delete branch)

 here after doing changes in another branch and then add ==> commit ==> push  (git push origin branchname ) this creates another branch 
 now you merge thosee branches this updates code in github in main branch which you merged with the branch you created 
 now for update of code in vscode in main branch code we do pull command so switch to main branch and enter pull command 


 //pull command 
 git pull origin main 
 used to fetch and download content from a remote repo ans immediately update the local repo to match that content 


 //resolving merge conflicts 
 an event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits 

suppose you did some changes in main branch and then then you swithed to other and did some changes on the same text now if you merge those both branches 
git merge branchname 
now you would get error(conflict ) as you were trying to chnage the same 


//undoing changes 

case 1 : staged changes  ( if you added but not committed then for undo below )
         git reset   <--file name -->
         git reset

case 2 : committed changes (if already both added and commited if you want 1 undo for one commit)
         git reset HEAD ~ 1

case 3 : commited changes  ( for many commits if you want to undo many )

        git reset < -- commit hash -->       //for hash go to git log there will be hash for each commit paste the hash to which commit you want to undo 
        git reset -- hard  <--commit hash -->


//got checking all the commits     git log 


//Fork 
a fork is a new reposiotry that shares code and visibility and settings with the original upstream repository 
fork is a rough copy 
 
so like when you want someone repo copy to be in your account then instead of cloning entire and again creating a repo in your github you can just fork the repo of that someone then this will create a copy of that repo in your account 
you can even do the changes and then do commit changes 
for mergin with teh origin writer you can create a new pull request  on master branch
