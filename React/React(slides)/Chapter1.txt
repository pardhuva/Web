//React is an open-source javascript library for building user interfaces.
 focuses on creating reusable, component based UIs 
 uses declarative programming - where you describe the ui and react figures out like when state changes it happens (it takes the which route to take )
 efficiently updates the DOM using a virtual representation (Virtual DOM) 
   virtual dom is the inmemory lightweight copy of browser dom 
      so its like when a change occurs it will check with the brwoser dom ( this comparing is called reconcilation) 
      so it updates only the changes to the real dom, so that is why react is faster  
      ex: is you like an reel then the react changes only the like part remaining remains same 
 
//why React ?
   // simplifies complex UI with a componetn based structure 
   // improves performance using the virtual Dom 
   // encourages code reusability and vast ecosystem 
   // has a strong community and vast ecosystem 
   // supports modern features like hooks for state and lifecycle management 

//Real world usage of react 
 // facebook , instagram ,whatsapp, netflix 
 // used for single-page applications (SPAs) - reloads single page 
 // also used with react native for mobile apps 


//understanding components 
 components are the building blocks of a React application 
 They are reusable, moodular , and maintainable pieces of UI 

 Two main types :
   1. Functional components - simple javascript  components (.jsx), 
   2. class components  - uses ES6 classes , outdated, 

 each component can manage its own state and props (properties)
 props - inputs(data) passed from one component to another (arguments)
 state - memory (that can be changed ) (functions)

  //different types of components 
   Layout components - header, footer, sidebar, navbar      (main structure)
   UI components - button ,card, alert , modal              (reusable components )
   data components - productlist, userprofile , orderdetails   (that are used using props )
   form components - loginform , searchbox, feedback           (handles user  input and events)
   utility components - loader, errorboundary , themeswitch    ( manage app logic and state)
   page components - homepage, aboutpage, cartpage             ( combine  smaller components to a full screen )


// React component hierarchy 
  App component 
   -> Header component 
   -> Footer component 
   -> Main component 
       -> ProductList component 
            -> productitem component
            -> productitem component 
       -> sidebar component 


//JSX (Javascript XML)
  // jsx stands for javascript XML 
  ex: const element = <h1> Hello, React </h1>
    it lets us write html tags which then react compiles that jsx into a standard javascript  using a babel under hood 

 // jsx  allows you you to write HTML-like syntax inside javascript (html embedded with js)
     function welcome() {
         return <h2> Welcome to reatc </h1>
     }
     this return one is jsx not html that react will render into the dom 
   
  // supports javascript expressions using curly braces {} (dynamic js embeddings )
      ex: return <h3> Hello, {name} </h3>
  
  // jsx makes ui code more readable and expressive 
  // enables embedding dynamic content directly in the markup 
    ex: return <h2> {isloggedin ? "welcome back" : "please sign in"} </h2>
  // Attributes use camelCase ex:  onClick, className 
      <button onClick ={handleClick}> Click me </button>     // in jsx 

  // JSX is compiled into React.createElement() calls behind the scenes 
      ex: //jsx 
       const element = <h1> Hello, JSX </h1>
        //compiled javascript 
       const element = React.createElement('h1',null, 'Hello,JSX')
  
   so jsx looks like html but react doesnt understand html babel helps converting to jsx into js 
   
  // must return one element per component 
     return (
        <>
        </>
     )
  

// doubts session 
 class components decreased over time because there you have to use className and specify those which takes memory  and all 
  and also functional components can be maintained in another component and it requires less code which makes it readable so functional components are more readable
