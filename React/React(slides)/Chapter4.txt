// moduel 2 of state and props 

What is prop drilling ?
 Prop Drilling( The Hidden problem in React)

 it is process where you pass data  from parent to child with different intermediary layers(components) , the intermediate components might or might not use the props 
 . Passing data throught multiple nested components 
 . Intermediaries forward props they dont use 
 . Leads to cluttered, hard-to -maintain code 
 parent -> child -> grandchild 

 (so simply even though the intermediate components  dont use the props they should pass it to the children which makes the code hard-to-maintainable) 
 prop Drilling example :
   App -> Dashboard -> UseCard -> username 

//propDrilling1
//propDrilling2

//solutions to prop drilling 
. React Context API 
. State Management Libraries (Redux, Zustand)
. Custom Hooks 

// demo1 
 prop drilling example to show dashboard, usercard, username , intermediary components 
   check these components in the practice folder above 

// what is Component Communication ?
  the Exchange of data between components 
  as  react is component based architecture which is build with small components , these components are required to have communication between them 
  that process is called  component communication , 
  as we know props  are the way through which they exchnage the data  

// why components  need to communicate ?
  . Components are modular and reusable 
    ex: header component 
  . Real apps share data (user info, theme, cart) 
     so in real apps components need to share data like theme, user info , communicate with each other for the whole functional web page
     so here these cart ,theme these are stored in parent so they can eb passed for many components that can be used in many components pages 
    
    parent <--> child data flow ensures consistency 

    parent -> child via props 
    child -> parent via callback functions 

    ex: //ComponentCommunication.jsx 

// why it matters 
 . promotes separation of concerns - each component focuses on one task 
 . encourages reusability - same component can display different data 
 . maintains consistency - one source of truth (state) across the app 
 . enables scalability - easier to extend features without breaking others 
 

// Types of  communication 
  //communication.png 

 / Parent -> child communication 
   pass props from parent to child 
    like in the above componentcommunication Header is that type 
     //ParentToChild 
 
 / Child -> parent communication 
    use  callback props (so when the child want to send some data to the parent )
  . parent defines function and passes it down 
  . child calls it to send data back 

   //ChildToParent 
   Parent -> defines function and passes ti as a prop to the children so the child component triggers that prop function (callback)
   then the parent function executes -> updates state / logs/alerts 
   
    //child doesnt change the state of the parent directly it sends  via callback to update it by itself 
 
 / sibling -> sibling  communication 
   when one sibling wants to share with another sibling but we have only parent <--> child 
   method is lifting state up mechanism to undergo this communication  
   it uses shared parent state ( so parent holds the state of both children)
    
// Global Communication 
   used to share data globally across the component 
   ex: language, authentication 
   uses createContext, Provider, useContext 
   contextAPI = global data store 
   so  creates a global context so no need to share from parent with intermediate components eliminates prop drilling 

   ex: like wifi so anyone who connects to wifi cna use direclty 


// best pratices 
  . use props for local communication 
  . avoid deep prop chains 
  . use Context API for global data 
  . keep components small and focused
