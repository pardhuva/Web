//state and props in React 

// what is state in React ?
  state represents data that changes over time in a component 
  it is managed within the component itself 
    App 
     - counter1 (Count =0)
     - counter2 (count = 10)

  causes re-rendering when updated 
  state = components memory 

  props - static input that is passed from parents 
  state is dynamic  data that changes in the component ( independent of other components(like parents))

  if there is no state then the component forgets the data after eveery re-render so state helps in remembering that data using state 


//Props vs state 
   Props -> passed  from parent 
    they are Read-only 
   State -> managed locally 
    they are mutable (can be changed directly)
   Props are external inputs, state is internal memory 
   both trigger re-renders when updated 


//Hooks 
  these are special functions in react that lets us add features, lifecycles methods 

// The useState Hook 
 syntax :
  const [state, setState]  = useState(initialValue)
 ex: 
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  state -> current state value 
  setState -> function to update the value 
  initialValue -> starting value 
usestate gives variable memory 

// how state updates work ?
  state updates are asynchronous 
  react batches multiple updates for performance 
   ex: 
      setCount(count +1)
  never mutate state directly (use the setter function)
   avoid count++   use  setCount(count+1)
  updating based on previous state 
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount +1)
  
  there should be ability to track changes and leading to re-render or unpredictable results  that is why we use setter functions instead of directly modifying 

//managing complex state 
  for objects or arrays, use the spread operator 
    ex: setUser({...user, name: e.target.value});
  maintain immutability for predictable updates 

// input form state 
  use useState to manage  form inputs 
  bind input value to state variable 
  use onChange event to update the state 
  demonstrates two-way data binding 

//common mistakes 
  mutating state directly (state.pus(), count++)
  calling  setState in loops without condition 
  assuming immediate state updates 
  storing derived data in state unnecessarily 
  use functional updates when new value depends on previous value 

//best practices 
  keep state minimal and relevant 
  lift state up when multiple components need it 
  split complex state into smaller pieces 
  always initialize properly (e.g. ,[],{} or null)


//quiz 
 1. In react props are immutable and state is mutable 
 2. state must be updated using the setter function 
 3. when state changes in a component , the entire component re-renders 
 4. state updates asynchronous in React because to allow batching and improve performance , to avoid blocking the DOM 
 5. correct way to increment a count value stored in state 
     setCount(count +1 ) (this is correct)       setCount(count++)  // this is wrong 
 6. if a parent component re-renders, what happens to its child components -> children re-render only if their props change 
 7. what happens if you mutate state directly instead of using the setter  -> the UI might not update correctly
