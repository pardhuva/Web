// React dom , 

what is dom ?
   the DOM (document object model) represents the structure of a web page 
   every element in HTML is represented as a node in the DOM tree 
    html 
    -> body 
      -> h1
      -> p
      -> button 
  updating DOM directly is slow and costly 

 so when there is change intially it used to re-render whole page again (both, css,js and  all) which takes time for larger websites 
 so vitual dom comes , react adapts virtual dom 

// what is the virtual dom  
  virtual  dom is a lightweight ,in-memory copy of the actual dom (Real Dom - Browser DOM (internally maintained by browser to maintain the UI basically a data structure))
   react keeps this virtual representaion to optimize UI updates
   results in faster and more effient rendering 

  Javascritp DOM - so when  you update something then it will update(re-render) whole page instead of the part that got updated 
  Virtual DOM -  so it has a copy now after a update then it will compare with the actual DOM and updates only the changes instead of re-rendering the whole page 
   this is fast 
   so react uses this virtual DOM 
  so when a update  occur then instead of directly updaing the real dom it only updates the virtual DOM (object), then uses smart algorithm  to find out the changes between the two doms  
    
demo - use some button when click it changes so state is getting changed so it re-renders where we use virtual dom 
   to check go to elements in browser there you can see when clicked only that part changes remaining remains same 


how virtual dom works ?
  / React compares the new and hte old virtual dom trees to find changes (Diffing)
  / only the changed parts of the real DOM are updated (Reconciliation)
     Browser DOM <---> Virtual DOM 
     old virtula dom is the actual real dom 
  user Action -> state change -> new virtual dom -> diffing with old virtual Dom -> update Real dom 

how React virtual Dom improves performance?
  -> avoids full Dom repaints 
  -> optimized rendering 
  -> reduces javascript execution time 
  -> intelligent rendering decisions 

 real life use cases of virtual dom 
  whatsapp, instagram, facebook, twitter 

//Functional components 
 functional components are javascript functions that return JSX. accepts props as inptu and return UI elements as output 
 do not use this keyword (unlike class Components)
 can use React Hooks (like useState, useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle 
 used widely in single page applications(SPAs) and modular design 

//how functional components work in react 
  /props : receiving input 
   parent component -> passes props -> child component 
   
   ex: //parent component 
      function App() {
         return <Greeting name="Rohan" />
      }
      //child  component 
       function Greeting(props) {
        return <h2> Hello {props.name} </h2>
       }
  / processing props 
  / virtual DOM creation -  when component is rendered react creates an virtual DOM tree  representing the current state of the application 
        new virtual DOM is created on the state change or component re-render 
  /re-rendering 
    old virtual DOM -> new virtual DOM -> highlighted change -> updated browser view 


//advantages of functional components 
 they are simplest and modern way to create Reatc components 
 do not use this keyword (unlike class components)
 support for Hooks enables powerful logic reuse 
 promote cleaner, reusablem and testable code 
 better performance with reacts optimization 
 easier to read, maintain and debug 


//Class components 
  ES6 classes that extend React.Component 
  use render() method to return JSX 
  can access props via this.props 
  can maintain internal state using this.state 
  can use lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount.
  less preferred in modern React, replaced largely by Functional components with Hooks 
  contains more boiler plate than functional components 

//when to use Class components ?
  maintaining older codebases 
  using legacy libraries
  needing lifecycle methods 
  migration scenarios 
  following OOP design patterns
