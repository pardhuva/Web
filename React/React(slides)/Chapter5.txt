// Lifing State up and  managing complex state structures 
// handling forms and controlled components 

why share state ?
  in react each component can have its own local state  but differrent component might depend on teh same  state, where the data depends 
  like in sibling to sibling communication 
   if they have seperate state  then inconsistency so instead of that they should share state 

   so we maintain a single source of state so multiple can access 

   shown in the figure code is wrong , which is maintained locally for each component 
   instead of that we should maintain a shared state  

   so as we know state in react is local to that component so we share to make it available to other

  so when more than one component depends on the same data then dont duplicate across the components instead use a shared parent componet that hold the state and this mechanism is called lifting state up  

//managing complex state 
  1. using objects/arrays - use spread operator 
  2. using useReducer - for grouped or complex updates 
      when multiple related fields change together , useReducer is more suitable , 
      you can change all values at once 
   useReducer cetralizes the state logic ,mkaing it easier to handle state related  changes  
   // it is used for forms , ui 
  3. split state logically to small to keep it simple 

 
 //handling forms in react
  in traditional html the user input  is the value kept in the value of the input but 
  in react , the value of the input is kept in component- state property and updated only with the setState function 
  in controlled component form data is handled by react component 
  controlled components are preferable for predictable updates and validation 
  controlled components means state that we meant 

  // for forms then use a single state object it is more cleaner way 

// use event.preventDefault() to control form submission
   so actually in normal html whenever we submit a form it re-renders the whole paeg for every submit 
   in react it will be handled through state and send it through api call.
   browser refresh doent happen , so the browser default action doesnt happen  

// using libraries 
  if in manual way suppose a form with email and password so we maintain state for each and validation condition for each seperately 
    and also include error state  , without library 
  if using library then everythign can be done in one place all the validations can be done at in place 

//controlled vs  uncontrolled 
  controlled compoennts are handleed by the react state whereas the uncontrolled components are handled in the traditional manner 
   controlled compoents have real time updates  
   in uncontrolled components mostly it is doen manually eveyrthing
