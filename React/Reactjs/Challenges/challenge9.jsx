/**
 * Challenge: Think critically - how would you pass in a prop that 
 * isn't a string datatype.
 * 
 * E.g. Say you want each Joke component to receive an "upvotes" 
 * and "downvotes" prop that is a number, as well as a prop with 
 * an array of comments, and a boolean of whether the joke is a 
 * pun (`isPun`).
 */

//then you have to send the data inside the curly braces like 
//upvotes = {10}
