//form handling 

 so if you have input and submit now if you submit then there is default submit behavious 
  it reloads for every submission this is its default behaviour 
  so now we have to remove that reload for eveyr submission 

  so elem argument you so use arrow function to call as there is parameter 
  then use elem.preventDefault this prevents the default behaviour 

//two way binding 
 so actually we will not deal with our website directly we tell everything first to react it deals with the website you dont have direct control 
 
 so whenever you want to write something  on the input instead of of directly writing onto the input box directly 
 we let react handle it so that is when we use useState so some title,setTitle then here you change when onChnage is invoked  using  setTitle  -> this will change the titl evalue which interms change the value inside the input box 
 in this way two-way binding is done without changing value directly we use setTtile which changes title which interms changes the value of the input 

in this way whenever we deal with some form submitting or some submitting we use two-way binding
