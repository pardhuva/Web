//Gallery project 
 simply api calls with axios 

 // so when a user logins then his username and password is sent to the backend 
   of they are valid then the backend sends the access token and refresh token to the frontend 
   the access token is stored in memory whereas the refresh token is stored in cookie 

   so these two are sent to the frontend and  now so whenever you send a request to hte backend then for every api call the access token is attached in the header with the request 
    so if it is valid only then the requst is processesed 
     but the access token lifetime is short nearly 15min then it expires 
     but whereas refresh token lifetime is long until you logout or like 7days 

     so whenever the access token expires then refresh token creates a new access token 

   you can aks like they why to create a access token cant you direclty usse refrehs token because 
    if a attacker stoles the refresh token he cna misuse your account till long so refersh token simply jsut exists
    so even if the attacker steals the access token he can only use it for 15 mins 


//so first we get the objects from the api and then using state you print them after clicking the button with the help of map 
  and then you use useEffect where you put entire getData into that useEffect so you re-render whole page based on dependencies 
   and then you added the prev and next button so based on that indices the page re-renders so we use index as the dependency 

//now try to componetnise them 

//infinite scrolling 
 so in youtube there is no end when you keep on going on youtube there will be no end it will give youo some video suggestions 
 so keep on scrolling it will reload and give me some videos 

 but in our project when we click those pages appears but we want like when you reload then those pages appears 
 so for this scrolling based api call  so when you scroll then the scroller value changes then call for api
