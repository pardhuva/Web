//Context API

  //props drilling -> passing of props from parents ot children 

  so suppose 
   main 
      App 
        Navbar 
           Sidebar 
              userprofile 
                   username 
  in this fashion data flows from top to bottom 
  but from bottom the data cannot pass 

if you check the contextAPI  folder there app and navbar 
   App 
      Navbar 
         Sidebar 
 here data passes from App to Navbar and then Navbar to Sidebar 
 you cannot direclty pass from App to Sidebar 


//in small applciation it is easy to pass in a certain line way app to nav then to side 
 but in big applications it is difficult that is where we need data centralization 
 means all can access 

ex: suppose i was sharing my netflix account to jk and jk is passing the account to v now 
    if i change the password then i have to tell to jk and jk has to tell to v 
    instead of this we maintain a dashboard 
    dashboard so there if there is change in password it will be visible there and then all the users can check from there 
    that is data centralization 

if we use contextAPI then there will be data centralization 
 means every  component can access even after any change 

//needed to understand contextAPI 
1. context  -> creating context
2. provider -> providing this context to everyone 
3. useContext -> make them use useContext 


now check the code 

contextAPI2 
 instead of passing you centralize that is you wrap it 
 after creating ThemeContext you wrap it around App so it can be accesses everywhere 

 if you wrap then the whole App component is not displaying only ThemeContext is getting displayed 
  so here ThemeContext is parent of App  so go to ThemeContext and print {props.children}

  so now create context -> createContext()
     provide data       
     use the data 
 after creating context export -> so export that context 
 suppose -> export const ThemeDataContext = createContext()
 now providing -> <ThemeDataContext.Provider> </ThemeDataContext.Provider>
