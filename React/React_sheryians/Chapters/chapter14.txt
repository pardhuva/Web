//React Router DOM Basics

Why we use it

    React doesn’t have inbuilt routing — it’s just a UI library.
    So to handle navigation between pages/components,
     we use the react-router-dom library.

 install it - npm install react-router-dom

Types of Routers in React Router DOM 
 1. BrowserRouter :
    Uses the HTML5 History API (pushState, popState).
    Used for client-side routing (no page reloads).
    Best for modern web apps hosted on servers configured to handle client routes.
    Example URLs:
        pardhuva.com/        →  /
        pardhuva.com/courses →  /courses
        pardhuva.com/about   →  /about
    The server must redirect all routes to index.html.

   ex: Browser-router.jsx

 2. HashRouter 
   uses URL hash fragments(#) for routing 
   server doesnt know about routes - it only sees the part before #
   commonly used for static sites like those deployed on github pages.
   ex: 
    pardhuva.com/#/
    pardhuva.com/#/courses 
    pardhuva.com/#/about 
 
   ex: Hashrouter.jsx 

3. MemoryRouter 
   
   Does not use the browser’s history or URL.
    Stores navigation in memory (not visible in the address bar).
    Mostly used for:
        Testing environments
        Mobile apps
        Non-browser environments

| Router Type       | URL Style                | Uses History?    | Best For                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **BrowserRouter** | `/about`                 | ✅ Yes            | Real web apps               |
| **HashRouter**    | `/#/about`               | ❌ No (uses hash) | GitHub Pages / static sites |
| **MemoryRouter**  | No URL shown (in memory) | ❌ No             | Testing / non-browser apps  |



so actually browser history 
 When you visit websites, your browser keeps track of all the pages you visit — that’s called the browser history.
 it keeps those visited urls 
 so back and forward are possible 

That’s the browser’s built-in navigation system — it keeps track of your route history.

but memoryrouter doesnt have this so it cant go forward and back it can only go to that specific route url 

4. StaticRouter - that helps in generating static sites 
   

//you can ask like actually routing is handled traditionally by backend right but why here react is dealing with it 
  first yes traditionally routing si handled by the backend 
  in old style we app(like django,spring boot) 
  every url like /,/about,/courses was a seperate HTTP request to the server.
  the server decides which html page to send back 
  ex: 
    GET /              → send home.html
    GET /about         → send about.html
    GET /courses       → send courses.html

//but in React, we use client side routing 
 react is frontend library - but modern web apps are often single page applications (SPAs)
  in a SPA :
   . the browser loads only one HTML file (usually index.html)
   . the react app runs inside it.
   . when you navigate react does nto ask the server for a new page which leads to reloading of a new page 
   . instead it changes components on the client side 
   thats called client-side rouuting done entirely in the browser usign javascript 
   
   . React Router intercepts the click — stops it from making a network request.
   . It updates the browser’s URL (e.g., /about) using the History API.
   . It dynamically loads the <About /> component.
   . The page doesn’t reload at all.

   All of this happens on the frontend only.
   That’s why React needs to handle routing itself — because the browser never goes back to the server for each page.

//in backend 
 
 Backend routing → for data (API endpoints)

| Feature                    | Backend Routing       | Frontend Routing (React Router)  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Who handles route changes? | Server                | Browser (React)                  |
| Requires page reload?      | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                             |
| URL changes visible?       | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                            |
| Speed                      | Slower (reloads page) | Faster (only updates components) |
| SEO-friendly               | ✅ Usually             | ⚠️ Needs extra setup (SSR)       |
| Used in                    | Traditional apps      | Single Page Applications (SPA)   |


/** Routing was originally a backend job,
but in Single Page Applications (like React), routing moved to the frontend
so we can switch between pages instantly without reloading the browser.

 /client      → React app
/server      → Node.js backend

 Node.js handles backend API routes
 
 these API endpoints in chapter15 

so using this react-router-dom =>  SPA 
  only url changes the page will not reload 

in navbar if you check ther ein components if you use <a href='/'> this will reload for every component 
 so we use Link which is provided by react-router-dom 

//so total 
 basic setup 
 nested routes -> for suppose /product/shfd
 dynamic routes 
 usenavigate 
 404 page
