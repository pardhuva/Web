//we got the data from the api call before now how to manipulate or deal with that data 

 //useEffect

  so actually react used for ui 
  parallelly with ui there are other tasks will go parallel like api calling,dom manipulations ,timeout,interval 
  inaccording to main react process there are some other side tasks 

  so there should be side by should not be inside the main that is when useEffect used 
   
   so normally if we have some function inside the app then if we call that function it will be invoked multiple times whenever we do some change in the app body its useless 
   so if you use useState and useEffect which contains that function even then when we chaneg the state it invole the function 

 //what is the use first what is the reason it is invited
  Reason.jsx 
  so if you check there you can se ethat in any change change in the ui it gets re-rendered every time but actually it shoudl be like side differently only once 
  that is when we use useEffect  
  so actually the main react will be run and then side by some other tasks to be managed parallely 
  but actually they will not run in parallel so all those are stored in side stack we call it as microtasks 
  so when full rendering of react is done then these side processes will run side by side this is useEffect 

  so if you use some variable and use it usign useState then whenever the state changes then the useEffect runs for those times but that is normal without useEffect this is what is called mounting 
    useEffect(function() {
        console.log("use effect is running);
    })
  then what is the use of useEffect  
    so to take i tbetter we pass dependenceis we send function to useEffect 
     so now it will only run once because we passed the dependency 

     useEffect(function() {
        console.log("use effect is running);
    },[num])
    so now if you send the dependency which is num then if it changes(teh dependecy which is num) then it will run that useEffect again
    so when the state of the dependency changes then statement prints again 

    remove strictmode from main.jsx  
    you cna send any number of dependencies in useEffect
