//localstorage 
 it means memory of the browser 
  localStorage is a built-in browser feature (not from the website’s server) that lets your browser save small bits of data locally on your computer — even after you close or reload the browser.
   It’s stored by the browser, but it’s controlled by the website’s code.

   The browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) manages the storage.
   The website’s JavaScript code tells the browser what to store there.

   | Storage type          | Managed by      | Stored where     | Stays after reload               |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **localStorage**      | Browser         | User’s computer  | ✅ Yes                            |
| **sessionStorage**    | Browser         | User’s computer  | ❌ No (deleted when tab closes)   |
| **Database / Server** | Website backend | Website’s server | ✅ Yes, and shared across devices |

  you can remove the localstorage data by 
   localStorage.clear()
   sessionStorage.clear()

   to save items in localstoraeg in key-value pairs  
   localStorage.setItem('user','Sarthak')
