//api calling in react

 connecting frontend and backend -> though api 
  so for getting data from backend to frontend -> api 
    and also response frontend to backend -> api 

  so actually frontend requests from backend through api then 
   backend requests the database api for data then the database which is the actual storage of data will send you the response which is data 
   then the backend will send this response data to the frontend using api 

 now to get the data from the backend using api calls can be done in two ways 
  1. fetch 
  2. axios 
 here you used some fake api from jsonplaceholder 
 there you use async await because you wait until the call is resolved 
 there it returns promise can be in pending state you wait until the promise is resolved the api call is fetched 

 you cannto directly print consoel.log(reponse.json()) this is pritn at that current moment state it will not wait 
  so you have to use const data = await response.json()
                     console.log(data)

 const {data} = await axios('ht ') this is destructuring
