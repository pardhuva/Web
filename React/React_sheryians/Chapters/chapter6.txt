//Hooks 

we read  functional coomponents which are useful in building ui 
but for  state change or feature implement or code impleemnt or manage context in these cases functional component donot work welll 
that is when hooks used 

hooks are magical functions that are used to do different tasks 
 useState 
 useEffect 
 useReducer
 useRef
 useContext
 useCallback
 useMemo

1. useState -> manage(change) states 
   suppose messages before viewing some new message it is in one state after viewing hte new message it is in another state 
   so actually you want to change something in your website cna be any variable or anything but actually you should not chaneg directly 
   you have to make reactjs change it that is useState does changes the state 

2. useEffect -> manage side stack
  ex: a truck is going on which si react main function then on side many other bicycles go like other any functions or api calls

3. useRef -> to select dom element 
   actually normally in reactjs you actually dont render using document.get() you try to change it directly using usestate 
   gets the reference 

4. useContext -> manage the global context 
    suppose you have some website  if the sections in the applciation deal with the same data then you make hte data globally available 

5. useReducer -> manages complex logics 
    like checking user loggedin or not for next access 
    or manage local storage data

useState (basic state)->(advance version) -> useContext (global state)-> (advance version)-> useReducer(complex global state)

6. useCallback and useMemo -> for optimisation 
   suppose if somethings re-rendered repeatedly then avoids unnecessary re-renders
