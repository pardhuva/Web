Components ??
 so whole website can be made as component based architecture so 
 
 so if you take instagram all the features all are seperate components and also 
 for everyone the features and all are same only jsut the data is different that is when props deal with 

 ** from parent you can send data to child but the reverse is not allowed 

 //props 
 it is object which contains key-value pairs 
 so you can use it for the same component for multiple data 

//relative paths 

 | Relative Path          | Meaning / Use Case                         | Example (Current folder = `/home/user/scripts/`)           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`                    | Current folder                             | `.` → `/home/user/scripts/`                                |
| `./file`               | File in current folder                     | `./run.sh` → `/home/user/scripts/run.sh`                   |
| `./folder/file`        | File inside a folder within current folder | `./utils/helper.py` → `/home/user/scripts/utils/helper.py` |
| `../`                  | Parent folder (one level up)               | `../` → `/home/user/`                                      |
| `../folder/file`       | File inside a folder in parent folder      | `../pics/pic1.jpg` → `/home/user/pics/pic1.jpg`            |
| `../../folder/file`    | File inside a folder two levels up         | `../../user2/file.txt` → `/home/user2/file.txt`            |
| `../../../folder/file` | File inside a folder three levels up       | `../../../other/file.txt` → `/home/other/file.txt`         |


// even for each component you can explicitly can have css file 
 like seperate header.css file, footer.css file etc....

 //feature based vs atomic design structure
