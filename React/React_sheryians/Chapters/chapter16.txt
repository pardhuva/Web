//Advanced Routing 
  check advanced folder 

  here you dont need to add there navbar and footer for every other component you just need to only define the component 
  mentioned in the navbar 

  In React Router, <Outlet /> is a placeholder (or “slot”) that tells React where to render child routes inside a parent route.
  <Outlet /> = placeholder for rendering nested routes.

  useParams() from 'react-router-dom' -> get the parameters from url suppose /courses/1 this will return the 1 as the parameter 
  
  this using of useparams and that routing /courses/:id these are called dynamic routing 

//now using useNavigate from 'react-router-dom' you can get this and assign it to some variable 
 now you can sue this variable anywhere to navigate 

 suppose if we use this in about page where you have one return to home page button so when clicked you go to that function where you assign 
   variable if -> navigate('/') this will navigate to the hoem page 

    so you can also give navigate(-1) this goes one step backward
