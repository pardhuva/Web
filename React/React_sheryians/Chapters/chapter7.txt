//useState hook 
  if you do in the normal approach try to increment that will not update on the webpage because 
  suppose you have incremented the a value in the fucntion then it will be only incremnted on teh local copy of that function it will nto change on the original global copy 
  react doesnt know anything that it was changed because you didint change state or 
   you ddidnt trigger to re-render the componet so it shows hte vold value 

   react ui updates only when it re-renders, 
   re-render happens only when state or props change 
   changing a variable is invisible to react 

   so use useState 
    this will update the stored value and 
    automatically re-rende rhte component 
    draw the new value on screen 

 //on usestate when you do change the function you invoke right there dont use argument 
  ex: increment(count) 
   you have access to the count throughout the function so dont use arguments seperately 

   these setCount these will be executed asynchronously so if you have console.log() in that increment function that will be updated slowly compared to count because that setCount is asynchronous 

in useState it can be anthing like array,objects,strings,number 
 for arrays adn objects you do destructuring to modify the key-value pairs 

setnewArray(prev=>([...prev,60])); -> batch updates
