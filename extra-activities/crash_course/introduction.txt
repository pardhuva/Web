computers are nothing but just simple machines that perform complex actions through many layers of abstraction 

//its origin 
1. earliest is abacus for additions and those all 
2. astrolabe : to enable ships to calculate their latitude at sea 

computer - richan braithway 

punch crads - paper cards with a grid of locations 

transistors can be used to build logic gates which can evaluate boolan statements 
in boolean algebra only two binary values : true adn false  

binary digit 1 or 0 is called bit 
8bits - 1 byte 
1 kilobyte : 1000 bytes (10^3)
1 megabyte : million bytes (MB) (10^6)
1 gigabyte : billion bytes (GB) (10^9)
1 terabyte : trillion bytes (TB) (10^12)
1 quadillion - (10^15)
1 quintillion - (10^18)
1 sextillion- (10^21)
1 septillion - (10^24)

that is why the photos are so clear because they use millions of bits 
32 - bit (31bits for data and 1 bit for sign ) 1- negitive 0-positive 
range is +- 2 billion roughly 

64-bit around 9.2 quintillion 

computers should have memory known as addresses in order to store and retrieve values 
even you should be able to store the folating point numbers 
32-bit floating point number 
1 bit sign bit + 8bits exponent + 23 bits significand bits 
625.9 => 0.6259 x 10^3  => here significand is 6259 and 3 is exponent 

letters also can be represented through bits 5 bits ar eenough to reprsent 26 letters 
but for lowercase and upper use  7bit 

//how computers calculate:
ALU(arithmetic and logical unit ) the mathematical brain of a computer 
it includes two units arithmetic and logical unit 
1. arithmetic unit 2. logical unit 
arithmetic unti which is responsible for handling all numerical operations (these operations are done using the gates half adder and full adder ar eused for these )
logic unit - performs logical operations like AND,OR,NOT 

//alu has flags in it that helps during the operations 1. overflow, 2. zero, 3.negative 
so with the gates we cna build simple ALU that performs arithmetic and logicoperatios 
as something shoudl store the output or the intermediate results that is when RAM is used

//memoery 
memoery is a latch that stores 
group of latches operating is clled register which holds a single number and the number of bits in a register is called its width
