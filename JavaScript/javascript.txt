//it is a programming language
//javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language (execute solly one command at atime and in a particualr order in a syncronous way )

js code that contains instructions that the computer takes and returns the output

in inspect at console you can write the javascript code that runs automamtically 
alert("pardhuva"); this gives the alert sign 

Console.log is used to log(print) a message to the Console
console.log("pardhuva");

to connect js with browser we use html file  as they are connected directly with webbrowsers
<!-- <script src="jsfilename"></script> -->
 script tag is written inside body tag

/variables in js
variable are containers for data 

/javascript is a dynamically typed
/unlike other languages storing values in their respective types in js we can store any value in the variable 

= is the assignment operator
/variable rules
.variables names are case sensitive;a and A are different 
.only letters,digits,underscore,$ are allowed (not even space)
only a letter ,underscore(_) or $ should be the 1st character
.reserved words cannot be variable names 

/let,const&var 
var :variable can be redeclared & updated a global scope variable
let:variable cannot be redeclared but can be updated a block scope variable
const:variable cannot be redeclared or updated a block scope variable
//check variables.js 

{} this is called as block we can redclare with let in different blocks 
if you declare a normal variable without any var let and all and next if you declare the same variable with let then the remaining instructions even will not run

/datatypes in js
Number,String,Boolean,Undefined,Null,BigInt,Symbol

primitive datatypes (7)
non-primitive datatypes -objects(arrays,functions)

objects-collection of values
ex:student object name string age number marks number
in objects key value pair

from objects you can even access individual fields  
ex: student["name"]  object["key"]
for accessing keys
ex: object.key or object["key"]

for modifying in objects normally ex:let a=10; next a=20; in this we will update but for objects
object["key"]=object["key"]+1 in this way we are modifying  using assignment operators

const variables cant be modified but const object keys can be modified like above

//in console you can perform all arithematic operations
even for strings "123"+45 gives the output "12345"

/operators
/arithematic operators
+ - * / modulus(% remainder) exponentiation(**) increment(++) decrement(--)

/assignment operators
= += -= *= %= **=
//comparison operators
== (equal to ) ===(equal to and type) !=(not equal) !==(not equal to and type)
> >= < <=

/logical operators true or false
logical AND (&&) OR(||) NOT (!)

/conditional statements
to implement some condition in the code
if ,if-else,if-elseif-else

/ternary operators
condition?true output:false output
age>18?"adult":"not adult";

//MDN docs  for other topics that are not discussed

alert("") it is a message you will get top of your wesite pop up
prompt("") it is also gives message and also takes the user input

//loops and strings
loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again
for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){} three steps in condition intitalisation stopping condition and the updation
there you are defining i only used inside loop but if you declare it as var it is global you can access outside the loop but mostly we wont use var

//while
while(condition){}

//dowhile
do{     } while(condition);

//for-of loop  and for-in loops used mostly in strings and arrays
for(let val of strVar){
}

for-in loops are used for objects or arrays for-of loops are not used for objects
for(let key in obj){  
}

//strings in js
string is a sequence of characters used to represent text
//create string 
let str="apna college";
String length
str.length
string indices   str[0],str[1],str[2]

//template literals 
a way to have embedded expressions in strings
`this is template literal`
//string interpolation 
to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders
`string text ${expression} string text`

//escape characters  in strings they will not be printed they do some action
\n this character gives the next line 
\t gives tab space
both counted as single character escape character length is 1

//string methods(do some work)
in javascript also they are immutable directly btu you can us euse these methods to modify
strings doesnot change in javascript they are inmutable 
they are builtin functions to manipulate a string
when methods are used new string will be created

str.toUpperCase()
str.toLowerCase()
str.trim()  //removes whitespaces
str.slice(start,end?)  //returns the part of a string 
you can also concat the strings using +
str1.concat(str2) //joins str2 with str1
str.replace(searchVal,newVal) only once it will be replaces if you want to repalce all then use .replaceALL ("","") then it wil replace all the oen that you want to replace
str.charAt(idx)  // it gives  the character  at the index idx

for some more string methods go to mdn and explore some more methods \

//arrays
collections of items
instead of using objects for same type of information to store like student marks stud1=20 stud2=21 so on that that it is better to use arrays
create arrays
let idols=["rm","jin","suga","v","hope"];

array is also type of object
key value pair but here keys are index numbers
arrays are mutable we can change th values if we know the index but not like strings they are immutable they cant be changed 

//looping over an array
loops are iterable they are used to iterate for itens like (string objects arrays) which are collections of items as string is collection of characters objects key vlaue pair collections arrays collection of items

//array methods
.length for finding the lenght of the string
Push() add to end
Pop() delete from end and return 
toString() converts array to string
concat() join multiple arrays and return result
unshift() add to start
shift() delete from start and return 
slice(startidx,endidx) returns a piece of the array
splice(startidx,delcount,newelements) change original array(add,remove,replace);  if you want to add then make delcount as 0
//for deleting arr.splice("si","counnt")   //for replace arr.splice("si","count","replace element")
dont try to use replace function here it is only for strings


//functions in js
block of code that performs a specific task can be ivoked whenever needed

//function definition
function functionName(){
    //do some work
}
//fucntion call
functionName();

function functionName(param1,param2,....){
    //do some work;
}

//arrow functions
compact way of writing a function

const functionName=(param1,param2)=>{   here arrow for using the variables in the function
    //do some work
}

//funciton that takes string as an input and returns the number of vowels in the string
//foreach loops in arrays

arr.forEach(callBackFunction)
callBackFucntion :it is a fucntion to execute for each element in the array
callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
//we use foreach we wnat to perform some work on each value of that datastructure
//(item,position,array itself)

//if a fucntion associates with an object we will call it as method
//the object can be any datastructure
 
//in js function can also be used as parameters or can be returned too  that fucntion we call it as higherorder fucntions

//for each value in the array print the square using foreach

//higher order function or methods- in which fuction is parameter or return type of another fucntion are called as higher order fucntions example callback fucntions

//array methods
//map methood
//creates a new array with the results of some operation the value its callback returns are used to form new array
//same as foreach but there no new array is created in for each but for map  new array is created

arr.map(callbackfunction(val,index,array))

//filter method
creates a newarray of elements that give true for a condition/filter
arr.filter(callbackfunction(val,idx,arr));

//Reduce method
performs some operations and reduces the array to a single value it returns that single value
like sum average


//DOM(document object model)

//three muskeeters of web
/html(structure) where the content resides
/css(style)     like design moving color
/js(logic)  adds logic to the webpage

//starter code
/these when you are directly writing the content(css or js) html file without creating another file 
<style> tag connects html with css
<script> tag connects html with js

//if we make seperate files then it will increase readibility, modularity  helps with browser caching 

//window object
the window object represents an open window ina browser itis browsers obejct(not javascripts) and is autoamtically created by browser
means  when an newtab is opened a javascript object is created
it is a global object with lots of properties and methods
window.document gives the entire document 
console.log() for printing whereas console.dir() works related to document ->prop methods

//DOM
actually window object is a new tab or new page and in that 
when a wen page is loaded the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page 
mean actually in javascript we cna access all the html tags how? all the content is converted into an obejct and javascript can access it this object is document obejct 
 this document object is present in window object

console.log is to print
console.dir  is for special objects like documents to print the properties and methods

for accessing html in js is console.dir(window.document) this gives the window document  for body we can use like document.body 

//for dynamic changes or manipulation we use dom objects

//DOM manipulation

//selecting with id
 document.getElementById("myid")
//selecting with class
 document.getElementsByClassName("myclass")
//selecting with tag
 document.getElementsByTagName("p")

//query selector  returns the node list 
document.querySelector("myId/mayClass/tag")   //returns first element    for id use #id
document.querySelectorAll("myId/myClass/tag")   //returns a NodeList

//properties for accessing the elements and changing their values
tagName: returns tag for element Nodes
innerText: returns the text content of the element and all its children
innerHTML: returns the plain text or html contents in the element  the  difference with innerText is that above it only gives the inner text but here it gives along with the tags
textContent: returns textual content even for hidden elements

//here if we use like above it will remains the same div.innerText="abcd" the old written one will be erased and the newone will be replaced  these are that i swhy called as dynamic changes at runtime

//part 2

//continuation of dom manipulation
//attributes
element.getAttribute(attr) //to get the attribute value
.setAttribute(attr,value)  // to set the attribute val 

//style to access and modify the style of any node
.node.style

//insert elements upto now we saw how to access and change the values of the elements now how to insert the elemetns

//for inserting the element it is two step process creating the element and add the element

let el=document.createElement("div")
node.append(el)  //adds at the end of the node(inside)
node.prepend(el) //adds at the start of node(inside)
node.before(el) //adds before the node(outside)
node.after(el)  //addss after the node(outside)

//delete element
node.remove() //removes the node

classList is the collection of the class attributes of the element 
element(node list) which will be returned when queryselector is used
element.classList  //returns the collection of the attributtes of the element 
//you can also add some more attributes using classList and remove attributes
element.classList.add("newattribute")
element.classList.remove("newattribute")


//events

//the change in the state of an object is known as event
events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may effect code execution
.mouse events(click,double click)
.keyboard events(keypress,keyup,keydown)
.form events(submit)
.print event and many more

//these arise form user interactions

//for buttons onclick is one attribute  
onclick="console.log('button was clicked'); alert('hello')""  //here some event is done we call it as event handling
//check in google for some more events mdn events
//these are all called as inline event handling (handling the events inside the html tag)

//event handling in js
node.event = ()=>{
    //handle here
};
if for event if you define multiple handlers then the last created handler is implemented

//event object
it is a special object that has details about the event
all event handlers have access to the event objects properties and methods
node.event=(e)=>{
    //handle here     //here e is the event obejct 
}

//actually handling events in two ways one is inline handling in html code drawback is html code becomes bulk other is eventshandling in js disadvantage is that for each event you have to create an event object so to avoid this you use event listeners
//event listeners
here we create functions for each event multiple event listeners are created to handle each event
node.addEventListener(event,callback)   //callback-function acts as argument to another function  so when the event specified is occured the function  is invoked it is type of handler
node.removeEventListener(event,callback) 
same eventlistener is used multiple times to handle different tasks like in events.js
//the callback reference should be same to remove 

//box.disabled=true; is used for disabling

//to add shadow effects
box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;
box-shadow: 10px 15px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);  

//for random choices Math.random() 
and here choices are 3 so if we create an array store those choices there and fro finding the random index 0 to 2 but the math.random gives interms of 0. so for o to 2 you multiply with number for that range 
for math.random*3 this gives the numbers between 0 to 2 


//two miniprojects 
//tic tac toe
//stone paper scissors

//classes &objects

//prototypes in js
a javascript object is an entity having state and behaviour (properties and method)
js objects have a special property called prototype
we can set prototype usign __proto__

means actually we define properties and methods for an object which was created by us
but prototype is a special property that id builtin which has both properties and methods
 for ex object.toString is an property that is builtin 

 //array is also a type of object
 it also have some builtin methods like arr.push() even we dont define they are builtin they are derived from prototype object
 //for all objects  in js each object inherit some methods from this prototype object
//even in objects we can create methods
in objects this represent the same object

we can also create a prototype so that some methods from one object can be used in another object
* if object and prototype have same mehtod then objects method will be used  

//classes in js
class is a program code template for creating objects
those objects will have some state(variables) and some behaviour(functions) inside it.
class MyClass{
    constructor(){

    }
    myMethod(){

    }
}
let myObject=new MyClass();

constructor method  is automatically invoked by new it initializes object

//inheritance in js
inheritance is passing down properties and methods from parent class to child class
class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}
** if child and parent have same method childs method will be used(method overriding)

//super keyword
the super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parentss properties and methods
super(args)    //calls parents constructor
super.parentMethod(args) 
//the child class is called derived class as it was derived from the parent

//if you create  constructor in the child class  before instialising  the object in the child constructor you have to  call the parent class constructor using super keyword
//to access the super class methods in chidl class you can use super.methodname();

//error-handling
if any error occurs the remaining code after the error will not be printed but  if you use trycatch then the remaining code will be take palce normally without halting
try-catch
try{
    ...normal code
}catch(err){   //err is error object
    ..handling error
}


//async await >> promise chains >> callback hello

//Sync in js
Synchronous 
synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of isntructions given in the program 
each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution 
//Asynchronous 
due to synchronous programming sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions which causes delay in the UI 
asynchronous code execution allows to execute net instructions immediately and doesnt block the flow 

//api is like when request is sent it gives the output
it might take some time so if we use synchronous it might take more time for remaining instructions after api so thats why we use asynchronous programming

setTimeout() //it is a function we will decide it when the function should execute 
//timeout means after how much time it should execute in milliseconds

//callbacks
a callback is a function  passed as an argument to another function

//callback hell
callback hell:nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure (pyramid of doom)
//this callbackhell is some kind  of disadvantage  and it is complex so we use promises

//promises
it is same like amazon assure that it will deliver the product means we call it as resolve promise is resolved and sometimes the order might cancel then we call it as promise is rejected
promise is for eventual completion of task.it is an object in js
it is solution to callback hell.

let promise =new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{....}) //function with 2 handlers
**resolve &reject are callbacks provided by js 
//promise total three states pending,resolved(fullfilled),rejected state

in functions also you can return promises (value) and also can keep track like whether it is resolved or rejected or fullfilled 
and you can also add settimeout to make the value to access when we want it like after 5secs like that 
then if you access the promise before the value is printed (before the settiemout) the promsie is in pending state if you access the value after the settimeout the it should be in resolved state then make sure to add resolve("success")

//a javascipt promise object can be 
 > pending:the result is Undefined
 > resolved:the result is a value      resolve(result)
 > rejected: the result is an error object   reject(error)


//there promises are used byus like resolving rejecting how to make someone to use these promises
.then() & .catch()

promise.then((result)=>{}) //it is performing some task  after promise is resolved  
promise.catch((result)=>{}) //it will some task after the promise is rejected 

//promise chain
//asynchronous function as we are using setTimeout() function 
//we use chaining because when we want the second action to be done after completion of entire first action like after entering username checking it then enter the password
if there is no chaining both will takes place at the same time 

//for chaining  actually when do you compelte the first fucntion action that it is in then after printing the result so for making
the second action to be after first insert it after the first in promise.then();

//same task using callBacks and also using promises and also same work using async await 

async await >> promise chain >> callback hell

async function always returns a promise 
async function myFunc()=>{ .... }
/await pauses the execution of its surroundings system async function until the promise is settled 
//means until the promise is resolved await() stops the execution

//await keyword is used only inside async function
//async-await() is used to do same task like those callback hell adn promises task of after first task compleitng full then the sencond task starts

async await is wasy to understand but disadvantage si that we have to call that async fucntion call seperatley so we use IIFE

//IIFE immediately involed function experssion 
iife is a fucntion that is called immediately as soon as it is defined 

(function)(); //iife 



//FETCH API-application programming interface
//like in resstaurant we order which is like request they prepare and giev us the items the preparation in thekitchen it was like api like the interface


the fetch API provides an interface for fetching(sending/receiving) resources
it uses Request and Response objects
when request is sent it sends us the data
the fetch() method is used to fetch a resource(data)

let promise=fetch(url,[options]);

//understanding terms 
//data format 
AJAX is Asynchronous JS & XML
JSON is JavaScript Object Notation (AJAJ) it is asynchronous js * json 

//when request is sent the api returns the response in JSON format then we convert it into js object (this conversion using json() method)

json() method : returns a second promise (first is returned by fetch() method) that resolves with the result of praising the response body text as JSON. (input is JSON output is JS object)

//request and response
HTTP verbs-(hypertext transfer protocol(like rules while sending requests))
Response Status Code 
*HTTP response headers also contain details about the responses such as content type,HTTP status code 
status:200 everything is okay  more than that means some error occured 
headers :contains some extra data comes along with response or send with request 

//task
//sending POST request


//if you invoke the functions and variables before intialising if you initialise them later not like other languages it willnt give error it will give the output only if you define the functions and variabels(it will give undefined ) ,and  if you didnt define them after then it will give error(not defined)
// the above is occuring because even before executing the code the space is allocated for all  (that is execution context)  so even you invoke the fucntion before initialising without paranthesis it will give the total element 
//the above things valid only if the fucntion is not written as arrow functions  because in arrow fucntions the function acts as a variable 
//hosting is that above three actions 

//global exceution context is created before execution and memory and code parts are allocated for eahc program before execution variables and the fucntions are allocated space and the  exceeution starts then the the variabels values re replace 
//and for every fucntion seperate global execuiton context is created
//the globalexecution fucntin of the overall code and the global execution contetx of the fucntions all are pushed into the call stack 
//after execution of the function the global execution context is poppedd from the call stack 

//along with the globla execution context global object is created that is window object 
//any variables outside the fucntion is called as globla space
